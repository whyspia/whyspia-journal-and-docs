# whyspia mission statements

Below are the core mission statements driving our project. Each reflects a piece of what we do.

---

## nurture community spaces for reconnecting with life üèØ

- Spaces where anyone can slow down, reconnect with what is alive for them, and do literally whatever they want ‚Äì all with the presence of other people closeby.

- Requires no money spent for visitors.

- Requires no traditional socializing.

- >"_do your own thing, with other people close...(or just chat, we are not your mom)_"

- Similar to: coffeeshop, computer lab, Student Union, community center.

- Both explicit quiet areas and nonquiet areas.

- Both in the physical world and a version in cyberspace.

## help people vibe with life ü§ù

- Our core question is: "_do you feel aligned and connected enough with the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life?_" - a more specific way of asking the abstract question of how much you vibe with life.

- We're here to help those who dont feel aligned or connected enough. We cannot guarentee that we help or our spaces help, but we can try. Often, this takes the form of helping people unlock their own agency. This could be through casual conversations, silent relaxation, rigorous rational analysis, or exploring what feels alive for you.

- The end goal is to vibe with life, which is a state where you feel that no change is needed in life, even when everything around you is changing or you are pursuing change. The process to vibe more with life is called heart alignment. To become more aligned or connected with the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life. Or if you already feel aligned and connected, then you're simply vibing.

## give and receive quests üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- A quest can be anything; for example: "_the first 3 people to do a backflip in front of me all get $50._"

- There can be no money involved or you can reward people for completing your quests.

- Then, at scale you have frens making money by taking quests from frens. Making money from all kinds of niche stuff that no one has ever made money from before. Making this a norm in the community could jumpstart an exciting future.

- This can be done completely word of mouth; however, we plan to create technology for posting, viewing, and accepting quests.

## learn, create, share, experiment, play üß†

- We want to learn. We want to create. Because we simply enjoy it.

- Resonance or participation is never guarenteed, but we strive to be a community where you can share, experiment, and play with new ideas or creations.

---

## create self-sufficient home & community üè°

- Create and use our own tech stack: from hardware to software.

- Our own Twitter, Instagram, AWS, phone hardware, network hardware, etc.

- Same vibe as living off the land (we want to do that eventually too). We want to survive. We want to protect.

- We want a home. We want a community. With roots in physical places, yet strong enough to transcend the physical.

---

## build home & community in cyberspace üåê

- Build a home in cyberspace.

- Build a community in cyberspace. A digital commons is part of this.

- Rooted in the physical home and community of whyspia, yet independent and more accessible.

- Ideally, create multiple forms of interface with our physical world: simple chat apps, current status apps, 2D worlds, 3D worlds, VR worlds, AR worlds...and connecting them together in interesting ways if desired.
